There are still two modes that can be used however, `Simple` or `Advanced`. Those are covered down below.

# How to Use (Simple Mode)

**You will need to restart your game after changing the amount of Simple Shortcuts you want and theres a limit (20) to how many shortcuts you can have.**

You first need to un-tick the "Use Advanced Shortcut Definition" at the top, click apply, then restart your game after you get prompted to do so.

Changing the Simple Shortcuts Amount at the top will require a game restart in order to load the new config entries.
To assign a shortcut to a result, you change the shortcut in the designated category, and then change the result.

# How to Use (Advanced Mode)

**This is a bit harder to follow but you can have nigh-infinite shortcuts with no restarts needed to add more.**

You first need to tick the "Use Advanced Shortcut Definition" at the top, click apply, then restart your game after you get prompted to do so.
Then after you restart your game you should see this in your Quick Chat Config Menu:

`,` creates a new Shortcut
